# DNNcausal 
The R-package DNNcausal implements estimators of average causal effect and average causal effect on the treated,
combining AIPW with deep neural networks fits of nuisance functions.
A possible use of the package is to use one-dimensional convolutional neural networks for time-series data inputs
(first introduced in Ghasempour et al, 2023).
Tensorflow and Keras are used to implement the neural network models.

Examples of use can be found at [Causal_CNN](https://github.com/stat4reg/Causal_CNN) or in the [Vignette](https://github.com/stat4reg/DNNcausal/blob/master/Vignette.pdf)
